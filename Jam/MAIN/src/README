Jam - make(1) redux 

This is Release 2 of Jam, a make-like program.

Differences from Release 1 are in CHANGES.
Easy reading instructions for using Jam are in Jamfile.5.

FEATURES

   ->	Jam's language is expressive, making Jamfiles (c.f. Makefiles) 
	compact.  Here's a sample:

	    MAIN smail : main.c map.c resolve.c deliver.c
			 misc.c parser.y alias.c pw.c headers.c
			 scanner.l getpath.c str.c ;

	This builds "smail" from a dozen source files, handling header 
	file dependencies automatically.

   ->	Jam is very portable: it runs on UNIX, VMS, and NT.  Most
	Jamfiles themselves are portable (like the sample above).

   ->   Jam is unintrusive: it is small, it has negligible CPU 
	overhead, and it doesn't create any of its own funny files.

   ->	Jam can build large projects spread across many directories
	in one pass, without recursing, tracking the relationships
	among all files.  (See the accompanying paper.)

   ->   Jam isn't under the abhorable GNU copyright - you can do
        anything you want with it (except copyright it yourself).
