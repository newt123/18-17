    This is Release 2.1 of jammin, a make-like program.
    The next release will be Release 2.2.

    License is hereby granted to use this software and distribute it
    freely, as long as this copyright notice is retained and modifications 
    are clearly marked.

    ALL WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.

    N.B.  This package was previously known as "jam - make(1) redux".
    To avoid infringing on JYACC's trademark of JAM, this package
    has been renamed to "jammin".  The command name and manual pages
    remain the same.

FEATURES

   ->	Jammin is a make(1) replacement that makes building simple things
	simple and building complicated things manageable.

   ->	Jammin's language is expressive, making Jamfiles (c.f. Makefiles) 
	compact.  Here's a sample:

	    Main smail : main.c map.c resolve.c deliver.c
			 misc.c parser.y alias.c pw.c headers.c
			 scanner.l getpath.c str.c ;

	This builds "smail" from a dozen source files.  Jammin handles 
	header file dependencies automatically and on-the-fly.

   ->	Jammin is very portable: it runs on UNIX, VMS, and NT.  Most
	Jamfiles themselves are portable, like the sample above.

   ->   Jammin is unintrusive: it is small, it has negligible CPU 
	overhead, and it doesn't create any of its own funny files
	(c.f. Odin, nmake, SunOS make).

   ->	Jammin can build large projects spread across many directories
	in one pass, without recursing, tracking the relationships
	among all files.  See the accompanying paper.  On UNIX, Jammin 
	can do this with multiple, concurrent processes.

   ->   Jammin isn't under the blinkin GNU copyright, so you can 
	incorporate it into commercial products.

INSTALLING

    Build jammin with make(1) on:

	    BSDI	    BSD/386 1.0
	    COHERENT	    COHERENT/386
	    DEC 3000/500    OSF/1
	    DG AViiON       DGUX 5.4
	    HP 9000/700     HPUX 9.0
	    IBM RS/6000     AIX		*
	    IBM PC	    FreeBSD
	    IBM PC	    Linux
            NeXT            NEXTSTEP 3.2
	    SGI R4000       IRIX 5.0
	    Sequent 2000    PTX V2.1.0
	    Sun 3           SunOS4.0
	    Sun 4           Solaris 2	*+
	    Sun 4           SunOS4.1
	    VAX             Ultrix 4.2

	    IBM PC	    NT		*
	
	    * requires editing Makefile
	    + only works with SUNSwpro CC (dirent confusion) 

    Build jammin with @build.com on:

	    VAX		    VMS 5.4
	    DEC 3000/500    OPENVMS	

    The Makefile (UNIX, NT) and build.com (VMS) are for bootstrapping.

    Once jammin is built, read the Jamfile man page and give it a try.
