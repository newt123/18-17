jam - make(1) redux

    +\	Copyright 1993, 1995 Christopher Seiwald.

    This is Release 2 of jam, a make-like program.

    License is hereby granted to use this software and distribute it
    freely, as long as this copyright notice is retained and modifications 
    are clearly marked.

    ALL WARRANTIES ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.


FEATURES

   ->	Jam's language is expressive, making Jamfiles (c.f. Makefiles) 
	compact.  Here's a sample:

	    MAIN smail : main.c map.c resolve.c deliver.c
			 misc.c parser.y alias.c pw.c headers.c
			 scanner.l getpath.c str.c ;

	This builds "smail" from a dozen source files, handling header 
	file dependencies automatically.

   ->	Jam is very portable: it runs on UNIX, VMS, and NT.  Most
	Jamfiles themselves are portable, like the sample above.

   ->   Jam is unintrusive: it is small, it has negligible CPU 
	overhead, and it doesn't create any of its own funny files
	(c.f. Odin, nmake, SunOS make).

   ->	Jam can build large projects spread across many directories
	in one pass, without recursing, tracking the relationships
	among all files.  See the accompanying paper.

   ->   Jam isn't under the blinkin GNU copyright, so you can 
	incorporate it into commercial products.

INSTALLING

    Build jam with make(1) on:

	    BSDI	    BSD/386 1.0
	    COHERENT	    COHERENT/386
	    DEC 3000/500    OSF/1
	    DG AViiON       DGUX 5.4
	    HP 9000/700     HPUX 9.0
	    IBM RS/6000     AIX		*
	    SGI R4000       IRIX 5.0
	    Sequent 2000    PTX V2.1.0
	    Sun 3           SunOS4.0
	    Sun 4           Solaris 2	*+
	    Sun 4           SunOS4.1
	    VAX             Ultrix 4.2

	    IBM PC	    NT		*
	
	    * requires editing Makefile
	    + only works with SUNSwpro CC (dirent confusion) 

    Build jam with @build.com on:

	    VAX		    VMS 5.4
	    DEC 3000/500    OPENVMS	*

	    * requires editing build.com

    The Makefile (UNIX, NT) and build.com (VMS) are for bootstrapping.
    Once jam is built, it can rebuild itself.
