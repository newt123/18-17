Jam - make(1) redux

November, 1993 - release 1
January, 1995 - release 2

FEATURES

    Jam is a make-like program that supplants make's implicit rules
    with a real language for defining dependencies and update
    actions.   Its features include:

    o       Jam finds header file dependencies using regexp(3)
	    patterns.

    o       Jam has a real language, including conditionals and
	    list valued variables.

    o       A central Jambase defines the rules, which can be
	    customized for large products.

    o       Per directory Jamfiles are simple and are normally
	    system independent.

    o       Jam can build large systems without recursing.

    o	    Jam never tries to store state in any funny files.

    o	    Jam runs on UNIX and VMS, and is portable.
