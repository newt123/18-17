Release notes for Jam 2.0.

1.  Release info:
	Jam 2.0 
	March 1, 1994
	VERSION 2
	PATCHLEVEL 3

2.  Limitations/Bugs

	The new Windows/NT support has only been marginally tested.

	Jam clean when there is nothing to clean claims it is updating
	a target.

3.  Porting

	Windows/NT is now (crudely) supported, courtesy of Brett Taylor
	and Laura Wingerd.  You'll need to look in the file Jambase and
	see what variables are expected to be set.

	COHERENT/386 is now supported, courtesy of Fred Smith.

	Solaris archive string table for long archive names is now
	supported, thanks to Mike Matrigali.

4.  Compatibility

	Jam 2.0 syntax is a superset of Jam 1.0 syntax, and thus it can
	interpret a Jam 1.0 Jambase.

	The Jam 2.0 Jambase is a superset of the Jam 1.0 Jambase, and
	thus it can include a Jamfile written for Jam 1.0.

5.  Changes from Jam 1.0 to Jam 2.0

5.1.  Documentation changes

	New Jamfile.5 manual page, with lots of examples and easy
	reading.  It replaces both the old "Examples" file as well as
	the old Jambase.5 manual page.

	jam.1 edited by Stephen W. Liddle and Diane Holt.

5.2.  Jambase Changes (see Jamfile.5)

5.2.1.  New rules:

	There are new rules to make handling subdirectories easier:
	SubDir, SubInclude, SubDirCcFlags, SubDirHdrs.

	There are new rules to handle file-specific CCFLAGS and HDRS:
	ObjectCcFlags and ObjectHdrs.

	Misc new rules: HardLink, InstallShell, MkDir.

	New rule "clean" that deletes exactly what jam has built, and
	"uninstall" that deletes exactly what was installed.

	New rules for handling suffixes .s, .f, .cc, .cpp, .C.

5.2.2.  Old rules:

	The InstallBin, Lib, Man, and the new Shell rules now take the
	destination directory as the target and the files to be copied
	as sources.  These rules formerly took the files to be copied
	as targets, and used built-in destination directories of
	$(BINDIR), $(LIBDIR), $(MANDIR), and $(BINDIR).

	The InstallBin, Lib, Man, and Shell rules use the install(1)
	program now, instead of doing their own copying.

	The Cc rule now uses -o when possible, rather than moving the
	result.  Some platforms (Pyramid?) have a broken -o.

	Jambase rules taking libraries, objects, and executables now
	all ignore the suffixes provided and use the one defined in the
	Jambase for the platform.

	Stupid yyacc support moved out of Jambase and into Jamfile, as
	jam is its only likely user.

	Jambase now purturbs library sources with a "grist" of
	SOURCE_GRIST.

5.2.3.  Misc:

	The names of the default rules defined in Jambase have been
	lowercased and un-abbreviated, to be more imake(1) like.

	The Jambase has been reorganized and sorted, with VMS and NT
	support moved in from their own files.

	The Jambase has been relocated on UNIX from /usr/local/lib/jam
	to /usr/local/lib.

5.3.  Jam changes (see jam.1)

5.3.1.   Flags:

	New -a (anyhow) flag: means build everything.

	New -j<x> flag: run jobs in parallel.

	Old -t now rebuilds the touched target, rather that just the
	target's parents.

	-n now implies -d2, so that you see what's happening.  The
	debug level can be subsequently overridden.

	New -v to dump version.

5.3.2.  Rules:

	New ALWAYS rule behaves like -t: always builds target.

	New EXIT rule makes it possible to raise a fatal error.

	New LAURA rule which say target depends only on the update
	times of the leaf sources.

	New NOUPDATE rule says built targets only if they don't exist.

	NOTIME has been renamed NOTFILE, to more accurately reflect its
	meaning (it says a target is not to be bound to a file).

5.3.3.  Variables:

	New special variable JAMSHELL: path and argv template for
	command execution shell.

	Variables, both normal and target-specific, can have their
	value appended with the syntax "var += value" or "var on target
	+= value".

	"?=" is now synonymous with "default =".

	Imported enviroment variable values are now split at blanks
	(:'s if the variable name ends in PATH), so that they become
	proper list values.

5.3.4.  Misc:

	Files to be sourced with "include" are now bound first, so
	$(SEARCH) and $(LOCATE) affect them.  They still can't be
	built, though.

	New modifier on "actions": "existing" causes $(>) to expand
	only those files that currently exist.

5.3.5.  Bug fixes:

	When scanning tokens known to be argument lists (such as the
	arguments to rule invocations and variable assignment), the
	parser now tells the scanner to ignore alphabetic keywords, as
	all such lists terminate with punctuation keywords (like : or
	;).  This way, alphabetic keywords don't need to be quoted when
	they appear as arguments.

	The scanner has been fixed to handle oversized tokens,
	unterminated quotes, unterminated action blocks, and tokens
	abutting EOF (i.e. a token with no white space before EOF).

	The progress report "...on xth target..." used to count all
	targets, rather than just those with updating actions.  Since
	the original pronouncement of targets to be udpated included
	only those with updating actions, the progress report has been
	changed to match.

	'If' conditionals now must be single arguments.  Previously,
	they could be zero or more arguments, which didn't make much
	sense, and made things like 'foo == bar' true.  The comparison
	operator is '=', and '==' just looked like the second of three
	arguments in the unary "non-empty argument list" conditional.

	Header files indirectly including themselves were mistakenly
	reported as being dependent on themselves.  Recursing through
	header file dependencies is now done after determining the fate
	of the target.

	The variable expansion support was expanding $(X)$(UNDEF) as if
	it were $(X).  It now expands to an empty list, like it
	should.

	The UNIX version of file_build() didn't handle "dir/.suffix"
	right.  Now it does.

	$(>) and $(<) wouldn't expand in action blocks if the targets
	were marked with NOTIME.  Now they expand properly.

	Malloc() return values are now checked.

	The variable expansion routine var_expand() is now a little
	faster, by taking a few often needed shortcuts.

	The VMS version of file_build() used the wrong length when
	re-rooting file names that already had directory compoents.
	This was fixed.

	Various tracing adjustments were made.
