/*
 * make1.c - execute command to bring targets up to date
 *
 * This module contains make1(), the entry point called by make() to 
 * recursively decend the dependency graph executing update actions as
 * marked by make0().
 *
 * External routines:
 *
 *	make1() - execute commands to update a TARGET and all its dependents
 *
 * Internal routines, the recursive/asynchronous command executors:
 *
 *	make1a() - recursively traverse target tree, calling make1b()
 *	make1b() - dependents of target built, now build target with make1c()
 *	make1c() - launch target's next command, call make1b() when done
 *	make1d() - handle command execution completion and call back make1c()
 *
 * Internal support routines:
 *
 *	make1cmds() - turn ACTIONS into CMDs, grouping, splitting, etc
 *	make1chunk() - compute number of source that can fit on cmd line
 *	make1list() - turn a list of targets into a LIST, for $(<) and $(>)
 *	make1remove() - remove targets after interrupted command
 *
 * 04/16/94 (seiwald) - Split from make.c.
 * 04/21/94 (seiwald) - Handle empty "updated" actions.
 * 05/04/94 (seiwald) - async multiprocess (-j) support
 * 06/01/94 (seiwald) - new 'actions existing' does existing sources
 * 12/20/94 (seiwald) - NOTIME renamed NOTFILE.
 * 01/19/95 (seiwald) - distinguish between CANTFIND/CANTMAKE targets.
 * 01/22/94 (seiwald) - pass per-target JAMSHELL down to execcmd().
